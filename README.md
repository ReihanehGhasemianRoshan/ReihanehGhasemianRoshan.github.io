## Welcome to my page!


I am Reihaneh (my friends call me Rero /ri:ro/). I received my M.S Computer Science from Shahid Beheshti University, and my B.S Statistics and applications from Allameh Tabatabaei University.
I defended my thesis which was fulfiled under supervision of Dr. Saeed Reza Kheradpisheh and Dr. Hadi Farahani. My thesis is mainly focused on the application of Deep Neural Networks and seq2seq learning in financial markets. Pytorch as a python library is my choice for coding to surpass the other researchers in related fields.
Currently, I am following new topics on Anomaly Detection and Contrastive Learning. My CV is available here(). You can find the summary of my skills in below.
